# Code Description

The code consists of two major parts, first is the data preprocessing (Removing drift from data (stationarity) and data smoothing) and the second part is computing the wavelet power spectrum of the actual data and establishing a background power spectrum at significance level 5% to compare the actual spectrum against.

## 1. Data preprocessing

### 1.1 Stationarity
A signal is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, frequency, and etc are not changing over time.
The mean of the time-series is increasing over the time. This trend can be removed using a polynomial regression.


### 1.2. Data smoothing 
Moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out fluctuations and  stand out important patterns.


## 2. Wavelet transform
Wavelet transform is mathematical tool to analyze time series data where features such as frequency varies over time.
Unlike Fourier transform, The wavelet transform has a high resolution in both time and frequency domains to obtain time-frequency
information. With the wavelet transform, it can be realized which frequencies are present in the signal and at which time these frequencies occur.

### 2.1 Wavelet power spectrum
Wavelet power spectrum can be computed from the wavelet transform. Following [1], to determine significance levels for the wavelet spectrum, a background spectrum is needed to compare the actual spectrum against. An appropriate background spectrum
is either white noise or red noise. 

A simple model for red noise is the univariate lag-1 autoregressive process:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_{n}&space;=&space;\alpha&space;x_{n-1}&space;&plus;&space;z_{n})

where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\alpha) is the the assumed lag-1 autocorrelation.

The power spectrum of red nosie is

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P_{k}&space;=&space;\frac{1-&space;\alpha^{2}}{1&plus;\alpha^{2}-2\alpha&space;\cos(2&space;\pi&space;k/N)})

where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?N) is the number of datapoints and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) is the frequancy index.
The mean background spectrum significant at ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?5%) is

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{1}{2}P_{k}\chi_{2}^{2})

where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\chi_{2}^{2}) is a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.
